This is my Project I did with my groupmates at UCSD for our Machine Learning class. Our project idea was taking datasets with Dota 2 data and cleaning it to be used in a Machine Learning model. Our model was trying
to predict the winner of the game based on the champions they selected. We implemented various Models and techniques to analyze the data. My responsibilities were geared more towards cleaning the data and helping 
put together the Machine Learning models.
